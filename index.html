<h1>Shivani's Blog</h1>
<p> Hi, my name is Shivani Parekh. My name means strength and I try to live up to that everyday. Some days it is really hard and I have to constantly fight to stay happy. Some days I don't talk to anyone all day. Some days I forget that I have friends and family who love me. I manage to convince myself that no one would care if I was dead. But I hold on. I tell myself that the next day will be better. I tell myself that if I keep working everything will work out in the end. I have a diary to write my thoughts and experiences and the lessons I learned from them. But I still have those dark days. I have days or even an entire week where I bottle up my disappointments and frustrations until I end up crying myself to sleep without anyone knowing. </p>

<p> However, today, on December 4, 2016, I know that I have accomplished a lot. Just being alive and living my life, just gaining new confidence and talking to new people everyday, those are major accomplishments. And my largest dream, my goal in life, is not o attend some fancy college. It is just to be the happiest and most giving person on the planet.</p>

<p> In order to accomplish this, I need to believe in myself. I need to believe in my friends. I need to be able to find friends in my family. And I believe that I can accomplish these first few steps this week.</p>
